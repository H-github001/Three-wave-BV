# Three-wave-BV
This is the MATLAB code for using Bred Vector (BV).
The worked example are three coupled waves. The associated dynamics shows a chaotic regime, under certain conditions.
There is a paper submitted to the jounral "Frontiers of Physics" describing out research.
The goal of our research is to use BV for introducing predictability for the nonlinear dynamics, including chaotic regimes.
